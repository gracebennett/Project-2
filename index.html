				<h2>Gilmore Girls: A Summary</h2>
				<p>For those who don't know, Gilmore Girls follows single mother Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter, also named Lorelai but who prefers to be called Rory, living in the fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The town is filled with colorful characters and is located approximately 30 minutes from Hartford, Connecticut . Ambition, education, work, family, and questions of class constitute some of the series' central concerns. The show's social commentary manifests most clearly in Lorelai's difficult relationship with her wealthy, appearance-obsessed parents, Emily and Richard Gilmore, and in Rory's interactions between the students at the Chilton Academy, and later, Yale University. Gilmore Girls is known for its fast-paced dialogue filled with pop-culture references.</p>

					<p>Jess is the nephew of local diner owner, Luke. He moves in with his uncle in the second season after his mother kicked him out for getting into too much trouble at school and with the law. Jess comes to us from a dark place but flourishes into his own person with the help of Luke, the Gilmores and the town of Stars Hollow. He is a bad-boy intelect who tends to make cringe-worthy bad decisions for himself.</p>

			<h2>The Evidence</h2>
			<h3>Appearance</h3>
				<div class="dean">
					<img src="images/Dean01.jpg" class="theboys" alt="dean">
					<h4>Dean</h4>
					<p>Dean's hair is just so pretty. Do you think his face would be that pretty without that hair? Propably not. He would look like puppet and it wouldn't be natural. He's been riding on that floppy hair of his for the whole series and once you get past the hair what is there?</p>

				<div class="jess">
					<img src="images/Jess01.jpg" class="theboys" alt="jess">
					<h4>Jess</h4>
					<p>Jess encompases everything that made young girls go crazy for James Dean or Jared Leto. His look is natural but smouldering. You know there's something deeper than what he's putting out to the world and readinga  book is always way better than glancing at the cover.</p>
					<p class="grade">Official Grade 10/10</p>
				</div>

				<div class="logan">
					<img src="images/Logan03.jpg" class="theboys" alt="logan">
					<h4>Logan</h4>					
					<p>Logan has an unbeatable combo: blond hair and baby-blues. He has the face for a poster boy and you can tell he knows it.WEe know he's been told his whole life that he's beautiful and hate that we can only agree- he's beautiful.</p>

				<h3>Chemistry</h3>
				<div class="dean">
					<img src="images/Dean04.jpg" class="theboys" alt="dean">
					<h4>Dean</h4>
					<p>None. Zilch. This is childsplay. Dean would either follow her around, call her 20 times a day or crizize her for her independant and alternative lifestyle. Fail.</p>

				<div class="jess">
					<img src="images/Jess04.gif" class="theboys" alt="jess">
					<h4>Jess</h4>
					<p>The chemisty between these two was what brought them together in the first place. It's what brought Jess back into her life again and again throughout the series. He challenged her intelectually and socially but remained her number one fan when she pursued her own goals.</p>
					<p class="grade">Official Grade 10/10</p>
				</div>

				<div class="logan">
					<img src="images/Logan04.gif" class="theboys" alt="logan">
					<h4>Logan</h4>					
					<p>Logan started out 10/10 on the chemistry scale. He could banter as well as Lorelai and argu with her as well as Jess could. It all went south in season 6 when he continuously pulled away form Rory and got too comfortable in his roll as BF.</p>

					<img src="images/Logan01.jpg" alt="Logan" class="theboys">
					<p>Let's be real. None of them were perfect. Dean repeatedly screwed up (broke up with her for not saying I Love You, deminished her feminist values and cheated on his wife with her), Jess was a hot mess until season 6 and by then it was too late and Logan was always too far up his own back-side to really every be truly invested in the relationship.</p>

			<h3>Their Best Moment</h3>
				<div class="dean">
					<img src="images/Dean05.jpg" class="theboys" alt="dean">
					<h4>Dean</h4>
					<p>This has to be when Dean built rory a car. HE BUILT HER A CAR AT 17! And not just any car. A super cute vintage, blue volkswagon bug. This is the only highlight of Dean and Rory's relationship.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="jess">
					<img src="images/Jess05.jpg" class="theboys" alt="jess">
					<h4>Jess</h4>
					<p>Jess wrote an entire book dedicated to Rory. After his breakdown in season 4, he comes back in season 6 with his life together and is a published author. His book was a metaphor for everything Rory wanted for Jess, he just needed to want to build it for himself, and he did.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="logan">
					<img src="images/Logan05.png" class="theboys" alt="logan">
					<h4>Logan</h4>					
					<p>In episode 19 of season 5 Logan fights to be exclusive with Rory, brings her to a family dinner then tells his entire family off when they say she wansn't "bread" for his family. Logan kills it this entire episode. After this episode... not so much.</p>

			<div class="worst clearfix">
			<h3>Their Worst Moment</h3>
				<div class="dean">
					<img src="images/Dean06.jpg" class="theboys" alt="dean">
					<h4>Dean</h4>
					<p>Where do you start? When he broke up with Rory because she wouldn't tell him she loved him? When he told her he wants a wife that only stays home and makes him dinner? When he cheated on his wife with Rory and then wouldn't stand up for her? When he dumped her AGAIN on her birthday? BOOOO DEAN.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="jess">
					<img src="images/Jess06.jpg" class="theboys" alt="jess">
					<h4>Jess</h4>
					<p>Oh, Jess. Your lowest point has to be when you showed up nearly manic at Rory's dorm in 4th season begging her to run away with you. It wasn't the right time and you were such a mess then. Since, we know you've cleaned yourself up and gotten things on track.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="logan">
					<img src="images/Logan06.jpg" class="theboys" alt="logan">
					<h4>Logan</h4>					
					<p>There are many for logan but the cake has to be for breaking up with Rory on the series finale because she wouln't marry him, move to California and put aside her own journalism career for him. Really? You just dump her? Great, Logan.</p>

		<h2>Nobody is perfect.</h2> <p>But Jess was for Rory. He was her one true match and with the <a href="">recent announcement of the series being revived on Netflix</a> there is hope that a reformed bad-boy Jess and a mature Rory can find their happy ending.</p>
